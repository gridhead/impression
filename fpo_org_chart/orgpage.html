                        <p>
                            Fedora has an active, engaged team that takes care of our main websites and all 
                            of our various community webapps. New folks who show up with an interest in code 
                            contributions find this an easy place to jump in. Members of the team are empowered 
                            to do the work they’re interested in and are connected to the other parts of the 
                            project related to getting those things done.
